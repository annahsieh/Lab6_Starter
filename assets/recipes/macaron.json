I\u2019ve packed ALL my tips into this video to help you out because no there really isn't any one foolproof, easy macaron recipe, they are finicky little guys.... If your macarons aren't picture perfect they will still be delicious, so grab you ingredents and let's get baking!\n\nRecipe: https://preppykitchen.com/french-macarons/\n\nTOP TIPS FOR MAKING FRENCH MACARONS\nTHE MERINGUE!!!! That meringue HAS TO BE STIFF! I had no idea French meringue could be whipped to such a thick marshmallowy consistency but all it takes is a bit of extra whisking. You\u2019ll notice the meringue start to fill the whisk when you\u2019re getting close to the right stage.\nAge your egg whites! Separate the eggs, place the whites in a clean glass, cover with plastic wrap and let them hang out in the fridge for a few days before using. This will dehydrate them and make them perfect for macarons.\nSift, Sift, SIFT! Those larger pieces of almond flour will mar the surface of your macarons. Best practice is to sift then whiz in the food processor and repeat two more times. Discard the larger particles, don\u2019t try to press them through the sieve.\nThe mixing will take some practice, you will fold and fold the batter and then use the spatula to GENTLY press the batter against the bowl. You want to remove some of the bubbles but not to many\u2026 Continue this until it reaches a thick \u201clava\u201d consistency. It should slowly fall off the spatula in ribbons and be able to form a figure eight without breaking.\nPipe the macarons perpendicular to the surface. If your tip is pointing a bit in any particular direction when you pipe the macarons might be oblong or malformed.\nAdd your coloring to the meringue after it reaches the soft peak stage.\nWhen you are finishing the piping motion stop squeezing the bag and pull up with a circular motion.\nThe macarons will be best after 2-3 days resting in the fridge.\nIf you over-bake the shells and they\u2019re too crisp, brush the bottom with some milk before assembly to soften them up.\n\nSUBSCRIBE \u25bahttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTvYEid8tmg0jqGPDkehc_Q?sub_confirmation=1\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\nADD ME ON:\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/PreppyKitchen\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/PreppyKitchen\nPinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/PreppyKitchen\nWebsite: http://www.PreppyKitchen.com","uploadDate":"2019-04-16T14:11:14+00:00","duration":"PT18M24S","thumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-Yz78dFgjKQ/hqdefault.jpg","contentUrl":"https://youtu.be/-Yz78dFgjKQ","embedUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-Yz78dFgjKQ?feature=oembed","@type":"VideoObject"},"recipeYield":["36","36 Macarons"],"prepTime":"PT15M","cookTime":"PT25M","totalTime":"PT40M","recipeIngredient":["100 g egg whites (room temperature 3 large eggs)","140 g almond flour (1 1/2 cups)","90 g granulated sugar (just under 1/2 cup)","130 g powdered sugar (1 cup)","1 tsp vanilla (5mL)","1/4 tsp cream of tartar (800mg)","1 cup unsalted butter softened (226g)","5  egg yolks","1/2 cup granulated sugar (100g)","1 tsp vanilla","3 tbsp water (30mL)","1 pinch salt"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToSection","name":"For the Macarons:","itemListElement":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Sift the confectioners sugar and almond flour into a bowl.","name":"Sift the confectioners sugar and almond flour into a bowl.","url":"https://preppykitchen.com/french-macarons-2/#wprm-recipe-3336-step-0-0"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Add the room temperature egg whites into a very clean bowl.","name":"Add the room temperature egg whites into a very clean bowl.","url":"https://preppykitchen.com/french-macarons-2/#wprm-recipe-3336-step-0-1"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Using an electric mixer, whisk egg whites.
